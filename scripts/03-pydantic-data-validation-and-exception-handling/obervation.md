Here are some drawbacks and improvements that can be made to the provided FastAPI code:
- **Drawbacks:**
    - **In-Memory Storage:** The tweets are stored in memory, which means they will be lost when the server restarts. This is not suitable for production.
    - **Lack of Data Validation:** The input data is not validated, which can lead to unexpected errors or security vulnerabilities.
    - **No Exception Handling:** There is no exception handling, which can lead to unhandled exceptions and server crashes.
    - **Missing Proper HTTP Status Codes:** Sends out same status code even if there's an error.
    - **Timestamp Generation:** The timestamp generation is done using the system time, which can lead to inconsistencies if the server's clock is not synchronized.


- **Improvements:**
    - **Data Validation:** Use Pydantic models to validate the input data.
    - **Exception Handling:** Add exception handling to handle errors gracefully.
    - **Proper HTTP Status Codes:** Add proper HTTP status codes.
    - **Use UTC for Timestamps:** Use UTC for timestamp generation to avoid issues with time zones.

- **Summary of Changes:**
    - **Pydantic Models:** Added Pydantic models for data validation.
    - **Exception Handling:** Used HTTPException for error handling.
    - **HTTP Status Codes:** Used HTTP status codes.
    - **UTC Timestamps:** Used UTC for timestamp generation.
    - **Response Models:** Added response models to the endpoints for better documentation and validation.

These changes improve the code's robustness, and maintainability.
