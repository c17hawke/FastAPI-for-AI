### Drawbacks and Improvements:

1. **In-Memory Storage**:
   - **Drawback**: Tweets are stored in memory, which means they will be lost when the server restarts.
   - **Improvement**: Use a persistent database like SQLite.

2. **Lack of Data Validation**:
   - **Drawback**: While Pydantic models are used, there is no validation for the existence of certain fields in the database.
   - **Improvement**: Use SQLModel to define the database schema and ensure data validation.

3. **Lack of Dependency Injection**:
   - **Drawback**: Database connection is not managed through dependency injection, making the code less modular and harder to test.
   - **Improvement**: Use FastAPI's dependency injection system to manage the database session.

### Summary of Changes:
1. **Database Integration**: Replaced in-memory storage with SQLite using SQLModel.
2. **Dependency Injection**: Managed database session using FastAPI's dependency injection.
3. **Data Validation**: Ensured data validation using SQLModel.
4. **Exception Handling**: Added exception handling for database operations by using SQLmodels.
